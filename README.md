# Inherited_Digital_KYC
In the loan management system KYC(Know Your Customer) is mandatory policy. Now in the process of KYC the important part is to match the selfie uploaded by the customer with the photo identity proof authorized by the government of India. As this was an Inherited Digital KYC system we do basic format checks of the document and save them to our s3 bucket.<br>
My Role: Development, testing and deployment.
